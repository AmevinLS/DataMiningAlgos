Algorithms from the subject "Data Mining" in Semester 4 of Artificial Intelligence program

## Apriori

In **algos.ipynb**, instantiate a `AprioriSolver` class with 
 - *list of transactions* (e.g. ["ABC", "CDE", "BCD"])
 - _minimum support_ (not as percentage, but as minimum number of transactions)

After that, use `apriori()`, `print_report()`, `get_closed_frequent()`, `get_maximal_frequent()` methods.


## AHC

First create dataframe of similarities with tuples as columns and index.
Then use `AHCSolver` and its `ahc()` and `print_history()` methods.
